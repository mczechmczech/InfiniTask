# InfiniTask
A task manager software for a business to keep track of assigned tasks.

A user of the software can either be a user or an admin. 
A user is able to view all jobs, search for a job, and sort the jobs.
An admin is able to do everything that a user can, as well as create more users and create more jobs.

Included in the repository is a test SQLite DB that I created for testing. The filepath to the DB must be mapped in the code where specified.
